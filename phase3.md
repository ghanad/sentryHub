# Prompt for AI Assistant: SentryHub Phase 3 - Dashboard Consolidation (Incremental Approach)

**Overall Goal:** Refactor the SentryHub Django project's dashboard structure incrementally by consolidating `main_dashboard`, `tier1_dashboard`, and `admin_dashboard` apps into a single new `dashboard` app, one dashboard at a time.

**Assumptions:**
* Phase 1 (Integration/Notification app creation & signals) is complete.
* Phase 2 (Alert processor refactoring) is complete.
* A shared site sidebar/navigation template exists within the `core` app (e.g., `core/templates/core/navbar.html`).

---
**Part A: Setup New Dashboard App**
---

**Task 3.A.1: Create New Dashboard App Structure**
* **Objective:** Create the basic structure for the new consolidated dashboard app.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Run the command: `python manage.py startapp dashboard`
    2.  Create necessary subdirectories:
        * `dashboard/templates/dashboard/`
        * `dashboard/static/dashboard/css/`
        * `dashboard/static/dashboard/js/`
    3.  Create an empty `dashboard/urls.py` file.
    4.  Add `'dashboard'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `settings.py`.

---
**Part B: Migrate `main_dashboard`**
---

**Task 3.B.1: Move `main_dashboard` View**
* **Objective:** Move the primary view from `main_dashboard` to `dashboard`.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Locate the main dashboard view (likely `ModernDashboardView` in `main_dashboard/views.py`).
    2.  Copy its *entire* definition (including its own imports) to `dashboard/views.py`.
    3.  Add standard Django imports if missing at the top of `dashboard/views.py`.

**Task 3.B.2: Move `main_dashboard` Template**
* **Objective:** Move the main template file from `main_dashboard` to `dashboard`.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Locate the main template (likely `main_dashboard/templates/main_dashboard/dashboard.html`).
    2.  Move it to `dashboard/templates/dashboard/main_page.html`.
    3.  Update the view moved in Task 3.B.1 (`dashboard/views.py`) to use `template_name = 'dashboard/main_page.html'` or render this path.

**Task 3.B.3: Move `main_dashboard` Static Assets**
* **Objective:** Move static files specific to `main_dashboard`.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Check `main_dashboard/static/main_dashboard/`.
    2.  Move any *specific* CSS/JS files to `dashboard/static/dashboard/css/` or `dashboard/static/dashboard/js/`.
    3.  Update `{% static %}` tags in `dashboard/templates/dashboard/main_page.html` to use the new paths (e.g., `{% static 'dashboard/css/main_dashboard.css' %}`).

**Task 3.B.4: Configure URL for `main_dashboard` View**
* **Objective:** Create a URL pattern for the moved view within the `dashboard` app.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Open `dashboard/urls.py`.
    2.  Import `path` and the specific view moved in Task 3.B.1 (e.g., `from .views import ModernDashboardView`).
    3.  Define `urlpatterns` and add a pattern for this view. Assign a unique name. Add `app_name = 'dashboard'`.
        ```python
        # dashboard/urls.py
        from django.urls import path
        from . import views # Or import specific view

        app_name = 'dashboard'

        urlpatterns = [
            path('main/', views.ModernDashboardView.as_view(), name='main_dashboard_new'), # Example
        ]
        ```
    4.  Open the main project `urls.py`. Add an include for the `dashboard` app *if it doesn't exist yet*: `path('dashboard/', include('dashboard.urls'))`. Remove the *old* include for `main_dashboard.urls`.

**Task 3.B.5: Fix Imports for Moved `main_dashboard` View**
* **Objective:** Correct imports within the view moved to `dashboard/views.py`.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Open `dashboard/views.py`.
    2.  Focus *only* on the view moved from `main_dashboard`.
    3.  Review its import statements. Correct any imports referencing other project apps (`alerts`, `core`, `users`, etc.) to use the proper paths.

**Task 3.B.6: Update References to `main_dashboard`**
* **Objective:** Find and update references pointing to the *old* `main_dashboard`.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Search the *entire codebase* (including `core/templates/core/navbar.html`) for `{% url %}` tags referencing URL names from the *old* `main_dashboard.urls`. Update them to use the new name defined in `dashboard.urls` (e.g., `{% url 'dashboard:main_dashboard_new' %}`).
    2.  Search the codebase for Python imports like `from main_dashboard...`. Remove or update them if they are no longer needed or should point elsewhere.

**Task 3.B.7: Test `main_dashboard` Migration**
* **Objective:** Verify the migrated dashboard works correctly.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Run the development server.
    2.  Navigate to the new URL for the main dashboard (e.g., `/dashboard/main/`).
    3.  Verify it renders correctly, static files load, and links work.
    4.  Run relevant tests if you have them. Fix any errors specifically related to this migration step.

    3.  Modify the specific dashboard templates to `{% extend 'dashboard/base.html' %}` and use `{% block %}` tags.

**Task 3.E.2: Implement Access Control in Views**
* **Objective:** Apply consistent role-based access control.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Open `dashboard/views.py`.
    2.  Import necessary decorators/mixins (`login_required`, `user_passes_test`, etc.).
    3.  Ensure *all* views require login (`@login_required` or `LoginRequiredMixin`).
    4.  Apply `user_passes_test` or `UserPassesTestMixin` to restrict the Tier 1 view (e.g., `lambda u: u.groups.filter(name='Tier1').exists() or u.is_staff`) and the Admin view (e.g., `lambda u: u.is_staff`).

**Task 3.E.3: Refactor Templates for Conditional Display**
* **Objective:** Use template tags for role-specific content.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Review templates in `dashboard/templates/dashboard/`.
    2.  Use `{% if user.is_staff %}`, `{% if user|has_group:"Tier1" %}` (requires a custom template tag/filter `has_group`), etc., to show/hide elements based on role.

**Task 3.E.4: Final URL Configuration (Optional Refinement)**
* **Objective:** Refine the URL structure if desired.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Review `dashboard/urls.py` and the main `urls.py` include.
    2.  Adjust the base path (e.g., `/dashboard/`) or individual paths (`main/`, `tier1/`, etc.) if a cleaner structure is desired now that all are consolidated. Ensure `name=` values are consistent and used correctly in `{% url %}` tags.

**Task 3.E.5: Delete Old App Directories**
* **Objective:** Remove obsolete code.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  **Verify all migrations (Parts B, C, D) were successful and tested.**
    2.  Delete the directories: `main_dashboard/`, `tier1_dashboard/`, `admin_dashboard/`.

**Task 3.E.7: Run Final Migrations Check**
* **Objective:** Catch any remaining migration issues.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Run `python manage.py makemigrations`. Expect "No changes detected".
    2.  Run `python manage.py migrate`.

**Task 3.E.8: Update/Write Comprehensive Tests**
* **Objective:** Ensure full test coverage for the consolidated dashboard.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Consolidate/update relevant old tests into `dashboard/tests.py`.
    2.  Write comprehensive tests covering all views, role-based access scenarios, and conditional rendering in `dashboard/tests.py`.

**Task 3.E.9: Update Documentation**
* **Objective:** Reflect the final structure in documentation.
* **Instructions:**
    1.  Open `CODEBASE_DOCUMENTATION.md`.
    2.  Ensure descriptions for the old dashboard apps are removed.
    3.  Update the description for the `dashboard` app, explaining its unified role, key views, and role-based access.
